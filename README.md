# Tiny-M_SSB_1010
Smol Stealthburner Toolhead for Tiny-M

This repo is a combination of different mods to get the Smol Stealthburner working on the Tiny-M with its offset top-mounted MGN-12H x-axis rail.

Original Smol Stealthburner 1010 by Maverick on the Doomcube Discord. < ahref= "https://discord.com/channels/825469421346226226/909858082841067591/951228478278230057"/> Direct link to post /a> Maverick's previous SSB repo <a href= "https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Crucible/tree/main/Smol%20Stealth%20Burner"> can be found here. </a>

** SSB 1010 for Tiny-M not fully tested**

I have printed the SSB 1010 to verify fitment of parts, but it has not actually extruded any filament yet. Print and use at your own caution.

** Carriage Mod for Tiny-M**

Tiny-M carriage is based on < a href="https://github.com/flyespresso/antpower/tree/main/SMOL%20Stealth%20Burner%20MGN9C%20V0%20Gantry%20Mod"> flypower's MGN9C Carriage mod for the SSB. </a> There are three versions of the carriage mod included in this repo: 1. Carriage with a single 6x3 magnet made for the original Dragon hotend adapter. 2. Carriage with two 6x3 magnets made for the Revo Voron hotend adapter. 3. Low profile carriage for Revo Voron (x endstop lowered for clearance with toolhead PCBs).
